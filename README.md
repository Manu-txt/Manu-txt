Hi! I'm Manu, which is a nickname, but my real name is Emmanuel. I am a Computer Engineer major at Cal State University Long Beach. I am relatively new to programming with little knowledge of C and C++, but 
am looking to improve and develop new skills and learn more programming languages! If there is any feedback or advice anyone would want to give me, that would be extremely appreciated!
